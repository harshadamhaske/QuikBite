2. CSS (Design & Responsiveness): Enhances visual appeal with colors, typography, hover effects, and layouts using Flexbox and Grid. Ensures mobile compatibility.
3. JavaScript (Interactivity): Adds dynamic features like search bar focus effects, a smooth scroll-to-top button, and form validation for better user experience.
